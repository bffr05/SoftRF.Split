# Instructions

3D print two STL files from this folder: **Sleeve** and **Wall**. You may pick some printing advisories on [my Thingiverse page](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4558442).<br>
If you are unable to print the parts by yourself - you may consider to find an appropriate local 3D service provider and place an order with assistance of [Treatstock](http://www.treatstock.com) or [3DHubs](http://www.3dhubs.com/) portals.

Both regular and OLED faceplates for the enclosure has been borrowed from [SoftRF Prime MkII case](https://github.com/lyusupov/SoftRF/tree/master/case/v5). Use **Face** and **OLED Front** STL files from that folder.
