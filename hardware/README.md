If you would like to print the schematics I would suggest to use [this PDF file](https://github.com/lyusupov/SoftRF/blob/master/hardware/SoftRF-shield-schematics-rev1.1.pdf).

# Manufacturing

Grab [this ZIP archive](https://github.com/lyusupov/SoftRF/blob/master/hardware/SoftRF-shield-PCB-Gerber-rev1.1.zip) with Gerber files then place an order for a "PCB service".
I've used [ShenZhen2U](http://www.shenzhen2u.com/) and is pretty much satisfied with price, quality and turnaroud time.

An example of PCB service order:
